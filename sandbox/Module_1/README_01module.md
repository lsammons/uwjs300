### Module_1
## Week 1 homework

  1. Fork this repository.
  2. Using eslint, create an .eslintrc file that includes rules for the following:
    a. proper indentation of 2 spaces
    b. using semi-colons to terminate statements
    c. no use of undefined variables unless part of a global block
    d. no unused variable definitions
    e. always use strict equality/inequality
    f. always use single quotes
    g. no console statements left behind
    h. no dangling commas in object definitions
    i. max line length of 80 characters with 2 space for indentation (can ignore urls)
    j. no trailing spaces on a line
    k. require spacing inside curly brackets for objects
    l. enforce a newline before a return statement
  3. Lint the map-utils.js file and make the corrections necessary for eslint to verify it is clean.
  4. Commit (and push) your changes, which should include map-utils.js with your modifications, and a .eslintrc file, then initiate a pull request with the original, JSCRIPT300-Spring2016/Module_1 repository.
  5. If you have successfully created the .eslintrc file and corrected the map-utils.js, I will reply with a :+1:. Otherwise I will leave comments in the pull request indicating what still needs correction. You can re-submit the work again through another commit/push/pull request. If you don't wish to do so but instead just want the work graded as is, leave a comment stating such.
  6. I will close the pull request either once I've added the :+1: or you've indicated you're done working on it.
